# Why "The Manifestos"?

In a conversation between David Perell and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Marc concluded: <a href="https://youtu.be/tV6kDr1rwTs?si=1wqdEV1dhutJ3Hjg&t=4111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
*'It's amazing there aren't more manifestos.'*
</a>

Inspired by this, this list is created. The focus isn't on presenting personal perspectives. Instead, the aim is to offer a curated overview of some of the most transformative manifestos that have shaped human thought over the last 300 years.
